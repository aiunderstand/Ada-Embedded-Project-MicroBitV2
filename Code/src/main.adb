-- USN PROJECT TEMPLATE INTELLIGENT REAL-TIME SYSTEMS
-- Project name: [project name]
-- Project members: [name, name, .. ]


--This is a project template for the MicroBit v2, built against the embedded-nrf52833
--runtime (a Ravenscar/Jorvik-style profile) so we have a language-supported real-time
--OS for embedded targets. The runtime ships with the gnat_arm_elf toolchain that Alire
--installs, so there is nothing to copy by hand.

--Check out the many examples in the ADL for the MicroBit v2 to see:
--  1) How the various drivers can be used like the accelerometer,speaker  or wireless communication via radio
--  2) How ADA features like the Math library and Bounded_Vectors (Containers) can be used
--  3) How to structure your Ada tasks with a protected object to synchronize data or with entries to synchronize flow
--  4) How to perform a execution time analysis
--  5) How to integrate your Ada project with a Unity project over USB
