Ravenscar SFP Example
==============

In this example we will see the ravenscar small footprint (SFP) profile in action. 
With ravenscar, we can access the absolute time facilities in Ada.Real_Time. 

Note that this minimal example relies on the sfp-microbit runtime which is installed 
in GNAT Studio 2021 when installing ARM-EABI. This example can also be created by created a
new project and select the Microbit text scrolling example.
  
Not all microbit drivers are available such as ADC, buttons, etc but inspiration how to 
include those can be found in the ZFP examples.
